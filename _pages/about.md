Hello! I am Josh, a PhD researcher at ETH Zurich focusing on how digital tools and AI can support our democracy, a topic that intersects Complex Systems, Computational Social Choice, and Human-Computer Interaction.

In particular, I investigate how humans vote, discuss, make collective decisions, and interact with digital systems. I believe in the power of collaboration and the idea that democracy is a social technology that we need to constantly develop. I also advise governments and organizations on their digital participatory processes. In Switzerland, I have worked closely with the city of Aarau on the [StadtIdee](https://www.stadtidee.aarau.ch/abstimmung.html/2114) Participatory Budgeting program and also [Kultur Komitee](https://kulturkomitee.win/) Winterthur in their annual citizen assemly to fund art and cultural projects. 

Outside of work, I am an active member of the Taiwanese civic tech community, participating mainly in the [vTaiwan](https://info.vtaiwan.tw/) project, using AI & digital tools to find consensus among the public in multistakeholder governance. I am also enthusiastic about language revitalization and Indigenous history, as my Computer Science master research focused on speech recognition for vernacular Indigenous languages. I speak Mandarin with a Taiwanese accent, English with an Australian one, and terrible German in a broken Swiss accent.
